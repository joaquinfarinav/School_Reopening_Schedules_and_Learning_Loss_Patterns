# School Reopening Schedules and Learning Loss Patterns

The COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted education globally, with lasting consequences we still do not fully understand. This paper examines patterns of school closures during the pandemic, focusing on Chilean K-12 education. Using a comprehensive dataset comprising daily school opening statuses for the entire 2021 academic year across Chile, I am able to analyze the relationship between reopening schedules and learning losses. Hierarchical cluster analysis and data visualization techniques are employed to understand how school characteristics associate with these reopening patterns. My results reveal a clear link between COVID-19 cases and school openings, showing delayed reopening for public schools managed by municipalities. Surprisingly, early school reopening does not correlate with reduced learning losses in math and reading. Clustering identifies four reopening patters: fast, right after winter break, well into the second semester, and never completely. These results showcase distinct county-level management strategies, although surprisingly learning losses do not notably differ across these patterns.
